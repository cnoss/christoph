    "contentList": ""\nIn my pictures I deal with the artistic expression of human sexuality. It can focus on faces, bodies, partners or individuals. The erotic context is sometimes directly recognizable, sometimes not.\n\nI mainly refer to sequences from pornographic films that have emerged from the feminist \"good porn\" and \"sex-positive\" movement. I'm looking for emotional, human, intimate, erotic and also provocative moments.\n\n- My art is pornographic\n- My art is feminist\n- My art is sex-positive\n- My art is kinky\n- My art is political\n- My art is erotic\n- My art is diverse\n- My art is human\n- My art is provocative\n- My art is tolerant\n- My art is polarizing\n- My art is intimate\n- My art is personal\n- My art is wrong\n- My art is right\n- My art is what I see\n- My art is what YOU see\n"",

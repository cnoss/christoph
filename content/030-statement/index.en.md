In my pictures I deal with the artistic expression of human sexuality. It can focus on faces, bodies, partners or individuals. The erotic context is sometimes directly recognizable, sometimes not.

I mainly refer to sequences from pornographic films that have emerged from the feminist "good porn" and "sex-positive" movement. I'm looking for emotional, human, intimate, erotic and also provocative moments.

- My art is pornographic

- My art is political
- My art is erotic
- My art is diverse

- My art is provocative
- My art is tolerant
- My art is polarizing
- My art is intimate
- My art is personal
- My art is wrong
- My art is right
- My art is what I see
- My art is what YOU see

# Painting sensual portraits

The erotic personality is at the center of the series "Sensual Portraits" \
I am looking for the authentic and at the same time erotic character of the women portrayed. Nothing is staged or glossed over. The participants only stage themselves. Just as you want to see yourself, show yourself and how you feel attractive, erotic or sexy. Nothing distracts from the protagonist, not the background and also not the light. This creates a sometimes relentless smile that does not try to flatter or to hide anything.

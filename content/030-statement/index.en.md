# Painting the New Porn  Pop Culture 

I do art for adults. My pictures are about pornographic images. I want to show the power, the diversity, the pleasure and the joy of human sexuality openly, without taboos and in all its facets and varieties. Let‘s talk about sex!

In my pictures I show explicit scenes of contemporary, alternative and feminist pornography. The focus is on the portraits of those involved. I want to give a positive and free look at the portrayal of erotic sexuality. Sex is positive!

It is time to redefine the cultural relevance of pornography. As part of the new pornographic pop culture, I want to convey a different view of pornography. I would like to contribute that we can talk openly and freely about sexuality and think again. That we again understand sexuality as something deeply human and part of us. I would like to help rid the subject of sex of the ballast of power, ownership claims, taboos, prohibitions and ideologies. In order to be perfect as human beings, we must not separate, deny or suppress our sexual identity. Let‘s play with each other. Sex is a playground for adults.
